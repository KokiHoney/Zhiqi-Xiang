    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>The project I made this time is a website about fitness. Users 
        can log in to the website to record their daily fitness status 
        and check-in. You can record your daily fitness plan and 
        process, and formulate your own fitness plan to urge users to 
        complete their goals. At the same time, there is an icon on the
         webpage, which can record their own weight curve and system 
         curve, and users can clearly observe their own changing trends
          after recording their own data. In addition, the corresponding
           videos on the website are also provided for users' reference, 
           which can help them find their goals easily and quickly. At 
           the same time, you can communicate with others on the website, communicate with each other 
           and answer questions. The website can also be accessed on a variety of devices because of 
           its responsive design practices.</p>
    
    

  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <h2>"Health is only one step away from you"</h2>

    <h1>Targent audience</h1>
    <p1>This software is very suitable for the following users
        The first is for beginners who have just chosen fitness. They can use this website to 
        formulate a clear plan for themselves, so that they can do fitness activities regularly. 
        If they don't know which project is right for them, they can communicate with others through 
        videos on the website or forums to find a project that suits them best.</p1>
        
    <p2>The second is the group of people who do not have strong restraint on themselves, 
        but want to lose weight very much. More and more young people choose to exercise to make 
        their body more beautiful, but they often do not have the efficiency and plan to complete it.
         own goals. This website can help them set a plan over a period of time to help them do these
          exercises on a regular basis.</p2>
        
    <p3>The second is the obese people. Everyone wants to have this beautiful figure, not only for 
          good looks, but also for health. More and more people are getting fat and not getting 
          enough exercise to get them moving. This website can solve their problems. They can not 
          only find the corresponding videos on the website to follow at home, but also can discuss 
          fitness problems and share their experiences with other users in the discussion area on 
          the website after the gym workout.</p3>
